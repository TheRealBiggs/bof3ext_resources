"This here's the manor{{NLINE}}of Lord McNeil
"We's guarding the{{NLINE}}manor, yup
"This part of the wall{{NLINE}}collapsed...I'm fixin'{{NLINE}}it
"Mr. McNeil's afraid{{NLINE}}of thieves, so he's{{NLINE}}always shouting at{{NPAGE}}me to hurry up...{{NLINE}}I tell you...{{NPAGE}}rich folks jus'{{NLINE}}don't understand
"Just between you and{{NLINE}}me...McNeil's a greedy{{NLINE}}tightwad...{{NPAGE}}He takes all he can{{NLINE}}from us and gives{{NLINE}}nothing back
"It's my job to guard{{NLINE}}the McNeil manor from{{NLINE}}punks like you
"But to tell the{{NLINE}}truth, Mr. McNeil's{{NLINE}}pretty stingy...{{NPAGE}}It's not worth it{{NLINE}}for what we get...
"This new wall is{{NLINE}}like a vatallion...{{NLINE}}It can't be broken!{{NPAGE}}Hey...what is a{{NLINE}}{{COLRS,2}}vatallion{{COLRE}} anyway?
"It's inconceivable{{NLINE}}that anyone could{{NLINE}}get through this{{NPAGE}}new wall! Why?{{NLINE}}Because we're{{NLINE}}PRO-FESS-ION-ALS!!{{NPAGE}}We always do a perfect{{NLINE}}job!!
"You steal from us,{{NLINE}}McNeil takes what's{{NLINE}}left in taxes...{{NPAGE}}You just can't win!
"If it wasn't for my{{NLINE}}job here, I'd go up{{NLINE}}to Mt. Glaus myself,{{NPAGE}}and get that monster!{{NLINE}}Just kidding...I'm not{{NLINE}}quite that brave!
"I bet if we could{{NLINE}}get rid of that{{NLINE}}monster{{NPAGE}}we wouldn't have to{{NLINE}}worry so much about{{NLINE}}food...
"No matter how hard the{{NLINE}}repairs, it's all a{{NLINE}}piece o' pie!{{NPAGE}}I wonder who first{{NLINE}}thought of that{{NLINE}}expression? Don't you?
"Hey, if you ever need{{NLINE}}your wall fixed, give{{NLINE}}us a call, eh?
"You know, if he's got{{NLINE}}so many soldiers, why{{NLINE}}doesn't that McNeil{{NPAGE}}send some up to get{{NLINE}}that monster? Eh?
