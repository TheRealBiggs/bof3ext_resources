"I feel a lot{{NLINE}}better now that you're{{NLINE}}helping us, Momo...{{NPAGE}}Let me know if you{{NLINE}}need anything{{NLINE}}heh heh heh heh
"The crops get too{{NLINE}}big if you give{{NPAGE}}them too much{{NLINE}}chrysm energy...

"Lately I've been{{NLINE}}doing nothing but{{NLINE}}working on Mondue 8{{NPAGE}}But I don't feel{{NLINE}}like working right{{NLINE}}now so I'm resting{{NPAGE}}Maybe it's because{{NLINE}}I'm getting old...
"We burn our garbage{{NLINE}}in this furnace here{{NPAGE}}and use it to heat{{NLINE}}up the greenhouses
"I work in the{{NLINE}}disposal area to the{{NLINE}}west...{{NPAGE}}I've seen some pretty{{NLINE}}weird-looking stuff{{NLINE}}out there...{{NPAGE}}Big mutated crops{{NLINE}}that look like{{NLINE}}monsters or something!
"Dangerous? The{{NLINE}}enhanced crops?{{NLINE}}No!{{NPAGE}}Well, sometimes{{NLINE}}they get a little{{NLINE}}too big{{NPAGE}}They look a little{{NLINE}}creepy then...
"I used to think it{{NLINE}}was wrong to use{{NPAGE}}chrysm on crops like{{NLINE}}this...But they sell{{NLINE}}pretty good, so...
"These crops grow{{NLINE}}bigger and faster{{NLINE}}than other crops{{NPAGE}}But their taste{{NLINE}}leaves something to{{NLINE}}be desired...

"I wonder if these{{NLINE}}enhanced crops are{{NLINE}}really safe?{{NPAGE}}I haven't felt like{{NLINE}}eating the food here{{NLINE}}since I saw {{COLRS,2}}that{{COLRE}}...
"Did you see that?{{NPAGE}}Where could something{{NLINE}}like that come from?{{NLINE}}It's just not natural!
"You want to know{{NLINE}}where the director is?{{NPAGE}}How would I know?
"Thank you for{{NLINE}}everything...{{NPAGE}}I don't know how{{NLINE}}to show my thanks,{{NLINE}}but...{{NPAGE}}I'll do my best to{{NLINE}}get you to Wyndia!
"Stop your kidding,{{NLINE}}Mac!
"I wonder where{{NLINE}}Momo is...
Palet{{NLINE}}"Momo! So good to{{NLINE}}see you again!{{NPAGE}}Did you take care{{NLINE}}of our little problem?
"Thanks for helping{{NLINE}}out...{{NPAGE}}Why don't you rest?{{NLINE}}The room's on us
"We take the big trash{{NLINE}}that we can't dispose{{NLINE}}of here{{NPAGE}}to the disposal area{{NLINE}}to the west of the{{NLINE}}plant
{{TXTBX,05}}Palet{{NLINE}}"This cart is headed{{NLINE}}for Wyndia...{{NPAGE}}If you hide inside,{{NLINE}}you should be able{{NLINE}}to get by unnoticed

Momo{{NLINE}}"Won't they check the{{NLINE}}goods on the cart?
{{TXTBX,05}}Palet{{NLINE}}"Heh heh heh heh{{NLINE}}D...{{PAUSE}}don't worry...{{NPAGE}}Just make sure you{{NLINE}}hide really well
Momo{{NLINE}}"All right then...{{NLINE}}Let's try it{{NPAGE}}It's our best bet

{{NLINE}}"pukyu?
{{NLINE}}"pukyu?
{{NLINE}}"pukyu?
Momo{{NLINE}}"This?
Momo{{NLINE}}"That's right, we're{{NLINE}}going in this{{NPAGE}}We should be all right{{NLINE}}with this

Nina{{NLINE}}"Let's go, Ryu
Palet{{NLINE}}"Heh heh...{{NLINE}}Whew...{{NPAGE}}I was lucky that the{{NLINE}}people Balio and{{NLINE}}Sunder are after{{NPAGE}}turned out to be{{NLINE}}Momo and her friends
Palet{{NLINE}}"Those two will take{{NLINE}}care of them for me...{{NPAGE}}And no one need ever{{NLINE}}learn about the{{NLINE}}mutant plant!{{NPAGE}}heh heh heh heh
Palet{{NLINE}}"Where are you going?{{NLINE}}The inn isn't that way
Palet{{NLINE}}"As you know,{{NPAGE}}I worked as your{{NLINE}}father's assistant{{NPAGE}}when he built these{{NLINE}}reactors
Momo{{NLINE}}"Whatever...now, which{{NLINE}}machine needs fixing?
Palet{{NLINE}}"Heh heh heh...{{NPAGE}}Well, I've been{{NLINE}}meaning to tell{{NLINE}}you...{{NPAGE}}We managed to fix{{NLINE}}the machines ourselves{{NPAGE}}What I want your{{NLINE}}help with is...
Palet{{NLINE}}"Well, take a look{{NLINE}}at that...{{DURTN,48}}
{{TXTBX,06}}Momo{{NLINE}}"How cute...What is{{NLINE}}it?
Palet{{NLINE}}"C-c-c-cute!?{{NPAGE}}How can you say that?
Palet{{NLINE}}"We can't sell{{NLINE}}things like that,{{NPAGE}}so we take them to{{NLINE}}the disposal area...
Palet{{NLINE}}"But several days{{NLINE}}ago...{{NPAGE}}As we were collecting{{NLINE}}the crops to be{{NLINE}}processed and disposed{{NPAGE}}of at the dump, well,{{NLINE}}um, how should I{{NLINE}}say it...
{{TXTBX,06}}Momo{{NLINE}}"You found a mutant{{NLINE}}like that one?
Palet{{NLINE}}"We've been{{NLINE}}expecting you!{{NPAGE}}I tell you, it was{{NLINE}}pure luck to have met{{NLINE}}you there, Momo!
"You must be a{{NLINE}}buyer to come all{{NLINE}}the way out here
"Care for any enhanced{{NLINE}}crops? We grow them{{NLINE}}right here
"I came here to get{{NLINE}}some of those onions{{NLINE}}and potatoes they grow{{NPAGE}}They're selling real{{NLINE}}well in some parts
"Through the carefully{{NLINE}}applied use of chrysm{{NLINE}}energy,{{NPAGE}}we are able to grow{{NLINE}}crops faster and{{NLINE}}larger...{{NPAGE}}That's what we call{{NLINE}}'crop enhancement'
"They use conveyors{{NLINE}}to keep monsters away{{NLINE}}from the chrysm here{{NPAGE}}I suppose it'd have{{NLINE}}to be a clever monster{{NLINE}}to use a conveyor!
"Welcome to the{{NLINE}}Research Plant!{{NLINE}}Sightseeing?{{NPAGE}}Please be careful{{NLINE}}not to touch the{{NLINE}}chrysm reactors
"This is a Repsol-{{NLINE}}style chrysm reactor{{NPAGE}}It supplies the soil{{NLINE}}with chrysm energy
"Huh? Momo!?{{NPAGE}}You're Momo, Repsol's{{NLINE}}daughter, right?
Maybe...it's a{{NLINE}}giant onion?
Palet{{NLINE}}"Exactly!{{NLINE}}A huge mutant...{{NPAGE}}Everyone's afraid of{{NLINE}}it and won't go near{{NLINE}}the dump anymore
{{TXTBX,06}}Momo{{NLINE}}"It got mixed in{{NLINE}}with the chrysm ore?
Palet{{NLINE}}"Yes...{{PAUSE}}so...{{NPAGE}}We have no idea{{NLINE}}what we should{{NLINE}}do with it...
{{TXTBX,06}}Momo{{NLINE}}"All right...{{NLINE}}We'll take care of it{{NPAGE}}I mean, this wouldn't{{NLINE}}have happened if it{{NPAGE}}hadn't been for my{{NLINE}}father's reactors,{{NLINE}}right?
Palet{{NLINE}}"Thank you so much,{{NLINE}}Momo!{{NPAGE}}The disposal area is{{NLINE}}inside the mountain{{NLINE}}to the west of here...{{NPAGE}}I'll make arrangements{{NLINE}}for your visit
"Oh, that big mutant{{NLINE}}onion out front?{{NPAGE}}Who knows? Maybe{{NLINE}}there's someone who'll{{NLINE}}buy it
"Oh, that big mutant{{NLINE}}onion out front?{{NPAGE}}Who knows? Maybe{{NLINE}}there's someone who'll{{NLINE}}buy it
"We ship enhanced{{NLINE}}crops to Wyndia as{{NLINE}}well
"I hate it when these{{NLINE}}conveyors break{{NLINE}}down...{{NPAGE}}It's so much trouble{{NLINE}}to fix them!
"Dangerous? The chrysm{{NLINE}}reactors? No, not at{{NLINE}}all!{{NPAGE}}They don't have any{{NLINE}}effect on people
"You used to work{{NLINE}}with Dr. Repsol,{{NLINE}}didn't you, Momo?{{NPAGE}}Oh, you're his{{NLINE}}daughter?
"You've grown up into{{NLINE}}quite the pretty young{{NLINE}}woman, Momo...{{NPAGE}}When I last saw you,{{NLINE}}you were just a{{NLINE}}little girl...
It looks like 
Momo{{NLINE}}"Yeah...{{NPAGE}}But I wouldn't{{NLINE}}call it little!
Palet{{NLINE}}"How can we ever{{NLINE}}thank you, Momo?
Momo{{NLINE}}"Don't worry about it{{NPAGE}}See you later, Palet
Palet{{NLINE}}"W-w-w{{PAUSE}}-wait! Momo!{{NPAGE}}Where are you going?
Palet{{NLINE}}"The road is still{{NLINE}}blocked!{{NPAGE}}Why don't you stay{{NLINE}}here with us for a{{NLINE}}while?
Momo{{NLINE}}"But...{{NPAGE}}We have to get to{{NLINE}}Wyndia!
Palet{{NLINE}}"Wyndia!?{{NPAGE}}No problem--leave it{{NLINE}}to me!{{NPAGE}}I'll get you there!
Palet{{NLINE}}"Please...{{PAUSE}}don't{{NLINE}}worry--I have a plan
Palet{{NLINE}}"All right then!{{NPAGE}}We'll have everything{{NLINE}}ready tomorrow, so{{NLINE}}why don't you rest{{NPAGE}}here at the inn{{NLINE}}tonight?
"The director?{{NLINE}}Now that you mention{{NLINE}}it, haven't seen him{{NPAGE}}He goes off like{{NLINE}}this sometimes
"It's impossible for a{{NLINE}}mondue to make a{{NLINE}}mutant like that--{{NPAGE}}it simply doesn't{{NLINE}}have enough power
"I've had enough{{NLINE}}of this!{{NPAGE}}I don't want to{{NLINE}}touch this chrysm{{NLINE}}ore anymore!
"That big onion?{{NLINE}}We burned it
"I've seen a big{{NLINE}}mutant before...{{NPAGE}}But I've never heard{{NLINE}}of one that could{{NLINE}}talk before
"A living mutant{{NLINE}}One that moves and{{NLINE}}talks!?{{NPAGE}}Inconceivable!
"We don't get that{{NLINE}}many mutants that have{{NPAGE}}to go to the disposal{{NLINE}}area...
"Most of our guests{{NLINE}}are the buyers who{{NLINE}}come here
"Welcome to the{{NLINE}}Research Plant...{{NPAGE}}What?{{NLINE}}Experiments to make{{NLINE}}a living plant?{{NPAGE}}We don't do anything{{NLINE}}like that here!
"You have to be{{NLINE}}careful handling the{{NLINE}}chrysm ore, you know{{NPAGE}}You can get burnt
"It was Repsol,{{NLINE}}Momo's father, who{{NLINE}}came up with the{{NPAGE}}idea of infusing{{NLINE}}crops with chrysm{{NLINE}}ore like this
"We'll take you to{{NLINE}}Wyndia tomorrow,{{NPAGE}}so why don't you{{NLINE}}rest in the inn{{NLINE}}tonight?
"There's been so much{{NLINE}}trouble lately...{{NPAGE}}On top of that, the{{NLINE}}crops aren't doing{{NLINE}}good either...

"I tried using chrysm{{NLINE}}to make those enhanced{{NLINE}}crops...{{NPAGE}}But they just taste{{NLINE}}too bad!
"Can't make the crops{{NLINE}}grow like you want{{NLINE}}even with chrysm...{{NPAGE}}Should've known better{{NLINE}}in the first place
"More!{{NPAGE}}Raise the chrysm{{NLINE}}pressure!
"We can't!{{NLINE}}The machines aren't{{NLINE}}tuned sufficiently!
"The mechanic who{{NLINE}}worked here...{{NPAGE}}Said he didn't get{{NLINE}}along with the{{NLINE}}director, and ran off
"And we still don't{{NLINE}}know where the{{NLINE}}director is...{{NPAGE}}No wonder we're having{{NLINE}}so much trouble
"Since you need{{NLINE}}someone to take care{{NLINE}}of the crops...{{NPAGE}}and someone to take{{NLINE}}care of the machines,{{NLINE}}maybe making these{{NPAGE}}enhanced crops is more{{NLINE}}trouble than it's worth
"I tell you...{{NPAGE}}The only reason these{{NLINE}}stupid reactors even{{NLINE}}work without blowing{{NPAGE}}up is thanks to{{NLINE}}Momo looking after{{NLINE}}them all the time
"This reactor used to{{NLINE}}be able to make nice{{NLINE}}big crops...{{NPAGE}}But now it's all{{NLINE}}but completely broken{{NLINE}}down...
"People have been{{NLINE}}complaining about the{{NLINE}}enhanced crops...{{NPAGE}}and the prices are{{NLINE}}falling...{{NPAGE}}I can understand why{{NLINE}}the director would{{NLINE}}want to disappear
"Just between you{{NLINE}}and me...{{NPAGE}}I heard the mechanic{{NLINE}}who used to work{{NLINE}}here died of chrysm{{NPAGE}}poisoning...I wonder{{NLINE}}if Momo is OK...

"I used to buy the{{NLINE}}enhanced crops because{{NLINE}}they were cheap...{{NPAGE}}But now I'm being{{NLINE}}more careful about{{NLINE}}what I buy...{{NPAGE}}I don't want to eat{{NLINE}}anything that might{{NLINE}}be dangerous
"I wonder where the{{NLINE}}director has gotten{{NLINE}}off to...?{{NPAGE}}It's not fair of{{NLINE}}him to take off when{{NLINE}}we're so busy!
