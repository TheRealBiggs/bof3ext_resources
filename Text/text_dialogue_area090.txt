"Quite an impressive{{NLINE}}machine...
"It's just like the{{NLINE}}one that was under{{NLINE}}Castle Wyndia...{{NPAGE}}Hey...maybe they're{{NLINE}}connected somehow?
"When we were in{{NLINE}}Wyndia, Honey started{{NLINE}}it up for us...{{NPAGE}}I guess we'll have{{NLINE}}to do it ourselves{{NLINE}}this time...
"I guess it's what{{NLINE}}people in the Techno{{NLINE}}Age used to move{{NPAGE}}around...All I know{{NLINE}}is it's a machine{{NPAGE}}more complicated than{{NLINE}}any I've ever seen

"Will such a small{{NLINE}}and fragile boat even{{NPAGE}}hold up on the{{NLINE}}Outer Sea...?

"We'll need Nina's{{NLINE}}help if we want to{{NLINE}}get a passport...
"Tee hee hee...I{{NLINE}}don't mean to twist{{NLINE}}your arm like that,{{NPAGE}}but if you help me{{NLINE}}with the plant, I'll{{NLINE}}talk to my father{{NPAGE}}about the passport,{{NLINE}}OK?
"The princess{{NLINE}}certainly has a way{{NLINE}}with people...
"We'll need Nina's{{NLINE}}help if we want to{{NLINE}}get a passport...
"Momo hasn't changed,{{NLINE}}has she? I wonder{{NLINE}}about ?{{NPAGE}}Did I mention he's in{{NLINE}}the forest to the east{{NLINE}}of the plant?
"Momo... and ?{{NPAGE}}Let you out of my{{NLINE}}sight for a while,{{NLINE}}and you make all{{NPAGE}}sorts of friends,{{NLINE}}don't you, Ryu?
"Since Director Palet{{NLINE}}isn't around, I've{{NLINE}}been taking care of{{NPAGE}}the machines...I like{{NLINE}}making repairs and{{NLINE}}all, but when they{{NPAGE}}get that bad, it's{{NLINE}}a real chore!
"It's funny, isn't{{NLINE}}it...{{NPAGE}}How we all ended up{{NLINE}}together again...
"With everyone helping{{NLINE}}me like this...{{NPAGE}}I'll be finished{{NLINE}}in no time!
"What's an onion{{NLINE}}doing walking around{{NLINE}}like that!?{{NPAGE}}M...{{PAUSE}}mutant!?{{NLINE}}What's that?

"It's said that the{{NLINE}}machines have come{{NLINE}}down to us from an{{NPAGE}}older time...I don't{{NLINE}}really know for sure,{{NLINE}}but I guess it was{{NPAGE}}a mistake to use{{NLINE}}them on the crops{{NLINE}}like that...
"We've got more to{{NLINE}}worry about than just{{NLINE}}the crops!{{NPAGE}}We've got to do some-{{NLINE}}thing before there's a{{NLINE}}chrysm reaction!
"I don't know much,{{NLINE}}but...{{NPAGE}}What's wrong with{{NLINE}}plain old food?
"What can they be{{NLINE}}doing that they need{{NLINE}}so much gas...?
"pukya?{{NPAGE}}{{COLRS,6}}Maybe it has something{{NLINE}}to do with how {{NLINE}}was created{{COLRE}}
"Now we can finally{{NLINE}}get a passport...
"In the end, we had{{NLINE}}nothing but trouble{{NLINE}}with the enhanced{{NPAGE}}crops...I wonder if{{NLINE}}there are some things{{NPAGE}}we're not meant to{{NLINE}}tamper with?
"Wyndia...{{NPAGE}}It was Teepo's dream{{NLINE}}to go there some{{NLINE}}day...

"I may have upset{{NLINE}}my mother...But now{{NLINE}}I realize...{{NPAGE}}this is what I wanted{{NLINE}}to do--to travel{{NLINE}}again with my friends!
"So what if Nina ran{{NLINE}}away from home?{{NPAGE}}Just 'cause she's the{{NLINE}}princess doesn't mean{{NLINE}}she has to stay{{NPAGE}}cooped up in the{{NLINE}}castle all day every{{NLINE}}day, right?

"I thought surely we{{NLINE}}would be able to get{{NLINE}}a ship in Rhapala
"But Beyd is in{{NLINE}}Junk Town...?
