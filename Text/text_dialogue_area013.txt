"Looks like we'll have{{NLINE}}a good crop this year{{NPAGE}}But I guess it doesn't{{NLINE}}make much of a{{NLINE}}difference, 'cause the{{NPAGE}}taxes stay the same,{{NLINE}}good year or bad...
"But I guess they'll{{NLINE}}just end up being{{NLINE}}taken by McNeil for{{NPAGE}}taxes in the end...{{NLINE}}What a life...
"We're lucky that the{{NLINE}}monster's not around{{NPAGE}}anymore to take our{{NLINE}}food and crops...
"You got rid of the{{NLINE}}monster, right, Rei?{{NPAGE}}Thanks to you, things{{NLINE}}are a little better{{NLINE}}Thanks!
"I suppose that since{{NLINE}}you got rid of the Mt.{{NLINE}}Glaus monster...{{NPAGE}}I can look the other{{NLINE}}way if you want to{{NLINE}}steal something...
"The cattle aren't{{NLINE}}being stolen anymore{{NPAGE}}The crops are doing{{NLINE}}well...{{NPAGE}}The mayor must be in{{NLINE}}a really good mood
"woof woof!{{SOUND,02}}
"moo{{SOUND,00}}

"What're you doing{{NLINE}}sneaking around here?{{NPAGE}}You should go to{{NLINE}}the village--{{NPAGE}}everyone there's{{NLINE}}waiting to see{{NLINE}}you
"Not bad, not bad...{{NPAGE}}Now you won't have{{NLINE}}to hide your faces{{NLINE}}around the village
Rei{{NLINE}}"So, what do you want?
Rei{{NLINE}}"So, what do you want?
Rei{{NLINE}}"So, what do you want?
Loki{{NLINE}}"You see...Well...{{NPAGE}}There's something I{{NLINE}}want to ask you{{NLINE}}to do...{{NPAGE}}Will you listen?{{CHOIC,0,1,Sure,No way}}
Loki{{NLINE}}"You see...Well...{{NPAGE}}There's something I{{NLINE}}want to ask you{{NLINE}}to do...{{NPAGE}}Will you listen?{{CHOIC,0,1,Sure,No way}}
Loki{{NLINE}}"Good, good!{{NPAGE}}Well, I don't want to{{NLINE}}talk about it here,{{NLINE}}so...{{NPAGE}}could you come over{{NLINE}}there with me?
Loki{{NLINE}}"Oh, really?{{NPAGE}}Oh, well, that's{{NLINE}}too bad...I'll be{{NLINE}}seeing you around
Loki{{NLINE}}"Well, I'm sure you've{{NLINE}}heard the stories too{{NPAGE}}You know, the ones{{NLINE}}about Mr. McNeil?
{{TXTBX,05}}Teepo{{NLINE}}"That he's cheap and{{NLINE}}greedy?{{NPAGE}}Rei{{NLINE}}"There's lots of people{{NLINE}}like that...
Loki{{NLINE}}"Yes, but...{{PAUSE}}well,{{NLINE}}don't you think...{{NPAGE}}that McNeil is a{{NLINE}}little, well, too{{NLINE}}greedy?{{NPAGE}}{{PAUSE}}{{PAUSE}}Hmmm?
{{TXTBX,05}}Rei{{NLINE}}"So you're saying...{{NPAGE}}You want us "heroes"{{NLINE}}to steal everything{{NLINE}}back, is that it?
Loki{{NLINE}}"Um...well...{{NPAGE}}If you stole the tax{{NLINE}}money and gave it back{{NLINE}}to the villagers...{{NPAGE}}Teepo{{NLINE}}"It'll make us even{{NLINE}}more popular, right?
Loki{{NLINE}}"So you'll do it,{{NLINE}}then?
{{TXTBX,06}}Loki{{NLINE}}"Oh, thank you{{NLINE}}so much!{{NPAGE}}There's no time to{{NLINE}}waste! You should go{{NLINE}}tonight!
{{TXTBX,81}} {{NLINE}}   That night...{{DURTN,48}}
Loki{{NLINE}}"It's night,{{NLINE}}everybody!{{NPAGE}}Let's go, let's go!
Loki{{NLINE}}"They just finished{{NLINE}}repairing the wall, so{{NPAGE}}it might be hard to{{NLINE}}find a way in, but...{{NPAGE}}I'm sure people as{{NLINE}}resourceful as you can{{NLINE}}find a way, {{PAUSE}}right?
Loki{{NLINE}}"They just finished{{NLINE}}repairing the wall, so{{NPAGE}}it might be hard to{{NLINE}}find a way in, but...{{NPAGE}}I'm sure people as{{NLINE}}resourceful as you can{{NLINE}}find a way, {{PAUSE}}right?
Teepo{{NLINE}}"All right, let's go!{{NLINE}}Ryu! Rei!
"H-hello, Rei{{NPAGE}}N-nice weather, eh?
"The best way to get{{NLINE}}people to like you{{NLINE}}isn't with some{{NPAGE}}clever scheme...{{NLINE}}But to live simple{{NLINE}}and do your job...{{NPAGE}}Just like everyone{{NLINE}}else!
"When I woke up, there{{NLINE}}was this bag of money{{NLINE}}in front o' the house{{NPAGE}}I was so surprised!
"Oh, I returned it to{{NLINE}}the mayor as soon as{{NLINE}}I could...{{NPAGE}}It was the only thing{{NLINE}}I could do--I don't{{NLINE}}want Mr. McNeil angry{{NPAGE}}with me--he'd kick me{{NLINE}}out of the village!
"You boys did it,{{NLINE}}didn't you, Rei!?
"Everyone complains{{NLINE}}about the taxes, but{{NPAGE}}we would never dream{{NLINE}}of taking it back like{{NLINE}}that!
"You're in for it{{NLINE}}now...{{NPAGE}}Stealing the mayor's{{NLINE}}stuff like that...
This way to{{NLINE}}Yraall Road
Rei{{NLINE}}"Hey, Loki!{{NPAGE}}We did just like you{{NLINE}}said--we gave McNeil's{{NLINE}}money to everyone...

Loki{{NLINE}}"{{EFCTS}}SHHHHHH!{{EFCTE,09}}{{NPAGE}}Don't say that so{{NLINE}}loudly! People'll{{NLINE}}hear you...{{NPAGE}}If McNeil finds out{{NLINE}}he'll kill me...
Teepo{{NLINE}}"What are you so{{NLINE}}afraid of, anyway?{{NPAGE}}You said McNeil was{{NLINE}}the bad guy...
Loki{{NLINE}}"{{EFCTS}}SHHHHHHH!{{EFCTE,09}}{{NPAGE}}All right, all{{NLINE}}right...{{NPAGE}}Just don't talk about{{NLINE}}that here!{{NPAGE}}We can talk about it{{NLINE}}in the hut. You go{{NLINE}}on ahead, {{PAUSE}}OK?
{{TXTBX,05}}Teepo{{NLINE}}"...Rei...{{PAUSE}}{{NPAGE}}Something's wrong...
{{TXTBX,06}}Rei{{NLINE}}"We'll get that Loki{{NLINE}}fellow to explain{{NPAGE}}what's going on...
{{TXTBX,06}}Bunyan{{NLINE}}"I was hired to take{{NLINE}}care of the cows...{{NPAGE}}So whatever I say{{NLINE}}is going to be to{{NLINE}}the cows...

{{TXTBX,05}}Rei{{NLINE}}"What's going on!?{{NPAGE}}We're waiting for{{NLINE}}Loki...
{{TXTBX,06}}Bunyan{{NLINE}}"Hey, cow...{{NPAGE}}Did you hear that that{{NLINE}}fellow Loki thought he{{NLINE}}could have an easy{{NPAGE}}life if he got ahold{{NLINE}}of McNeil's money, but{{NPAGE}}he didn't know that{{NLINE}}McNeil was working for{{NLINE}}a big gang of crooks{{NPAGE}}that doesn't like{{NLINE}}being stolen from...{{NPAGE}}Sounds pretty{{NLINE}}dangerous, doesn't it,{{NLINE}}{{SOUND,00}}cow?
{{TXTBX,05}}Teepo{{NLINE}}"What does he mean,{{NLINE}}Rei?
Rei{{NLINE}}"It means...{{NPAGE}}We shouldn't be{{NLINE}}hanging around here{{NLINE}}too long...{{NPAGE}}I think we should{{NLINE}}be getting back{{NLINE}}home--quick!
"mooooo?{{SOUND,00}}
"Loki's taken off--{{NLINE}}he was just using you{{NPAGE}}I'd hide until all{{NLINE}}this blows over if I{{NLINE}}were you...
"I suppose I wasn't{{NLINE}}really fair to Rei{{NLINE}}and the others...{{NPAGE}}I mean, they probably{{NLINE}}didn't know what they{{NLINE}}were getting into...

"Did you hear the{{NLINE}}rumor that they were{{NLINE}}killed?
"Rei and the others{{NLINE}}have disappeared...{{NPAGE}}Word is McNeil's{{NLINE}}after 'em...
"That McNeil...{{NLINE}}I thought he was{{NLINE}}just tightfisted...{{NPAGE}}But he's pretty mean{{NLINE}}if you cross him,{{NLINE}}ain't he?
"You may lose your{{NLINE}}money to taxes when{{NLINE}}leading a simple life{{NPAGE}}but at least you{{NLINE}}won't lose{{NLINE}}your life!
"If only those boys{{NLINE}}had been honest{{NLINE}}workers, like us...
"moo{{SOUND,00}}
"mooooo{{SOUND,00}}
"moooooooooo{{SOUND,00}}
"moo?{{SOUND,00}}
"The day after the{{NLINE}}robbers broke in...{{NPAGE}}These two real mean-{{NLINE}}lookin' fellows came{{NLINE}}up to the manor...{{NPAGE}}I wonder who they{{NLINE}}were?
"woof woof!{{SOUND,02}}
"Loki?{{NPAGE}}Oh, you mean the{{NLINE}}guy who finagled{{NLINE}}Rei?
"There's no need to{{NLINE}}get in a fuss{{NLINE}}about it...{{NPAGE}}It's McNeil who's{{NLINE}}in the wrong, not{{NLINE}}us...
"What should I tell{{NLINE}}them if they start{{NLINE}}asking me questions?
"Well, yes, the taxes{{NLINE}}were always a little{{NLINE}}high...{{NPAGE}}but I never thought...
"So the taxes were{{NLINE}}always collected...{{NPAGE}}whether it was a good{{NLINE}}year or a bad year{{NLINE}}for the crops, right?
"Now that you mention{{NLINE}}it, I remember seeing{{NLINE}}some rough-looking{{NPAGE}}fellows going up to{{NLINE}}visit Mr. McNeil...
"So you're saying he{{NLINE}}had disreputable{{NLINE}}acquaintances, then...
"We've heard stories{{NLINE}}from all the farmers{{NLINE}}around here that the{{NPAGE}}mayor was selling{{NLINE}}crops illegally...
"From what everyone's{{NLINE}}saying, it sounds like{{NLINE}}the mayor was quite{{NPAGE}}a greedy little{{NLINE}}spendthrift...
"I'd be lying if{{NLINE}}I said I'd never{{NLINE}}believe Mr. McNeil{{NPAGE}}was involved in some{{NLINE}}kind of bad business
"I'm not goofing off!{{NPAGE}}I can't work while{{NLINE}}they're investigating,{{NLINE}}right?
{{TXTBX,03}}Garr{{NLINE}}"...{{PAUSE}}...{{PAUSE}}And that's what{{NLINE}}happened

{{TXTBX,06}}Nina{{NLINE}}"I don't know what{{NLINE}}to say...{{NPAGE}}It's all so big...
{{TXTBX,05}}Garr{{NLINE}}"I only just realized{{NLINE}}that while I have{{NPAGE}}fought the dragons{{NLINE}}for almost 500 years,{{NPAGE}}I still know almost{{NLINE}}nothing about them...
{{TXTBX,05}}Garr{{NLINE}}"Of course, Ryu{{NLINE}}himself is the one{{NPAGE}}who must be really{{NLINE}}curious about them...{{NLINE}}right, Ryu?
{{TXTBX,06}}Nina{{NLINE}}"I see...{{PAUSE}}{{NPAGE}}Let's concentrate on{{NLINE}}more urgent matters{{NLINE}}now, OK?
{{TXTBX,06}}Nina{{NLINE}}"Don't give me{{NLINE}}that look!{{NPAGE}}What if Syn City is{{NLINE}}the headquarters of{{NLINE}}that gang?{{NPAGE}}We should go check{{NLINE}}it out!
{{TXTBX,06}}Nina{{NLINE}}"No matter how hard{{NLINE}}we think about it...{{NPAGE}}We're not going to{{NLINE}}figure anything out{{NPAGE}}about the Brood just{{NLINE}}standing here!{{NPAGE}}So we should take{{NLINE}}care of the business{{NLINE}}at hand--{{NPAGE}}the investigation!
{{TXTBX,06}}Nina{{NLINE}}"So let's get going!{{NPAGE}}You know how to get{{NLINE}}to Syn City, right?
Nina{{NLINE}}"Oh, and by the way--{{NPAGE}}don't worry about{{NLINE}}McNeil...No matter how{{NLINE}}strong that tiger is,{{NPAGE}}he won't be able to{{NLINE}}break into the castle!
"I'm thinking about{{NLINE}}the meaning of life...{{NPAGE}}...zzz zzz...
"I wonder how bad{{NLINE}}taxes are going to{{NLINE}}be this year...
"Ya gotta work hard{{NLINE}}if you want to get{{NLINE}}ahead in life!
"Haven't seen Loki{{NLINE}}around lately...wonder{{NLINE}}where he got off to?
"moooo...{{SOUND,00}}{{NPAGE}}Pretty good, aren't{{NLINE}}I?
"It must be pretty{{NLINE}}serious for the{{NLINE}}princess herself to{{NPAGE}}come all the way{{NLINE}}from Wyndia...
"Boy, was I nervous{{NLINE}}when they said they{{NPAGE}}wanted to question{{NLINE}}me!
"I've heard that the{{NLINE}}gang McNeil was hooked{{NLINE}}up to has its{{NPAGE}}headquarters out west{{NLINE}}in Syn City
"I'm so worried about{{NLINE}}what's going to happen{{NLINE}}next, I can't work
"I've had it with the{{NLINE}}country...{{NPAGE}}Maybe I'll head off to{{NLINE}}Wyndia...
"But won't you have{{NLINE}}to work just as hard{{NLINE}}there as here?
"I wonder what's gonna{{NLINE}}to happen to McNeil...{{NPAGE}}An' I wonder what's{{NLINE}}gonna happen to us
"(sigh)...{{NPAGE}}Well, back to work,{{NLINE}}I guess...
"(snore) zzz....
"Looks like a big{{NLINE}}crop this year
"Ahhhh...{{NPAGE}}Nothin' like a smoke{{NLINE}}after a hard day's{{NLINE}}work, eh?
"Life will be a lot{{NLINE}}easier now that taxes{{NLINE}}are cheaper
"Cows sure have an{{NLINE}}easy job...{{NPAGE}}All they have to do{{NLINE}}is just sit there and{{NLINE}}eat grass...
